# qc-python-ubuntu

Quantum Computing Python tools.

For running instructions, see [jupyter-ubuntu](../jupyter-ubuntu/README.md).

 This images adds to `jupyter-ubuntu` the following packages,

* Qutip
* ProjectQ
* CirQ
* QISKit

Some nice Visual Studio Code extenstions are added as well. 

Note that Rigetti's packages are not installed because you must request the Forrest SDK from the web. 

Note that Microsoft QSharp is not included becuase that does not run in `Jupyter`. See the separate container [qsharp-vscode-ubuntu](../qsharp-vscode-ubuntu).
